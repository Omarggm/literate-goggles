    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      For many years, Bethany has been baking the most delicious pies at her
      home. In 2013, we opened our first store in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy
      little street near the Grand Market. People from all over the world fell
      in love with the soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies...
      The store became a success in no time.
      <br />
      2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop
      moved into a larger building. After receiving many requests, it became
      clear that our next step was making it possible to order pies from the
      comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. You are now
      looking at the result of this: our very own webstore, making it possible
      to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel like it!

      Bethany is famous for using only the best ingredients. This way, we can
      make sure our pies are the absolute bests
